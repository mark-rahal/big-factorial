# big-factorial
- Calculates factorials for large numbers (meaning, the factorial of the number is too large to store in the int data type)

- Written in Assembly on a Raspberry Pi 3 (ARMv8 instruction set)

- Uses linked lists to store the factorial

- The factorial is stored in reverse order for the calculation to work

- Due to the time complexity of reversing a large linked list, the digits outputted are in reverse order
